b) Identify the main mitigating measures to enhance cyber security for the ICES community 
c) Decide if there is a need for cyber security training tailored to the ICES community
d) Determine whether ongoing communication between the ICES IT, ICES Data Centre and cyber-security experts from ICES member countries would be beneficial and, if so, propose what format it should take.
