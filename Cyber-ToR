The workshop is planned for Wth - Xth online, and will be chaired by David Currie (IE) and Neil Holdsworth (ICES Secretariat).

The draft ToRs for this workshop are:
a) Create an inventory of the main cyber security challenges within the ICES community
b) Identify the main mitigating measures to enhance cyber security for the ICES community 
c) Decide if there is a need for cyber security training tailored to the ICES community
d) Determine whether ongoing communication between the ICES IT, ICES Data Centre and cyber-security experts from ICES member countries would be beneficial and, if so, propose what format it should take.
