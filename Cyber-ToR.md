## ToR Descriptors

| ToR | Description | Background | Science Plan Codes | Year  | Expected Delivarables|
|-----|-------------|------------|--------------------|-------|----------------------|
| a | Create an inventory of the main cyber security challenges within the ICES community | It's important to identify the key cyber-security challenges that are facing the ICES community.|4.1 | 2025 |An evaluated list of key challenges.|
| b | Identify the main mitigating measures to enhance cyber security for the ICES community |Once the challenges are identified we will list the key measures that can be taken to reduce their risk. |4.1| 2025 |A prioritised list of mitigating actions.|
| c | Decide if there is a need for cyber security training tailored to the ICES community |One of the most effective defences against cyber attacks is well-informed people with the right skills.  This ToR will determine whether there is a need for cyber-security training targetted at the ICES community and, if so, what it should cover. |4.1 | 2025 |List of training needs.|
| d | Determine whether ongoing communication between the ICES IT, ICES Data Centre and cyber-security experts from ICES member countries would be beneficial. |During the workshop it will be decided if there is value in a similar forum meeting on an ongoing basis - if so, it will propose what format it should take and, if required, draft resolutions. |4.1 | 2025 |Draft resolution form (if required).|

## Supporting information

**Priority:**
High.
Information security is a key area for ICES as a network which relies on the secure use and access to all types of information to perform its mission. The ICES Secretariat and all ICES member countries are under threat from cyber-attacks.  This workshop aims to encourage activities which reduce the vulnerability of critical systems and networks, and identify effective responses for when such attacks occur.
In June 2024 the ICES Secretariat suffered a ransomware cyber-attack.  The attack affected all in-house network and storage infrastructure including SharePoint, SQL Server databases, the www.ices.dk website, file shares, and Wi-Fi. During the weeks after the attack, ICES worked to bring the website back online and restore access to online tools and resources â€“ these were all available again by July 2024. As part of the recovery process ICES rebuilt their systems, ensured that no traces of the ransomware remain, and now have active monitoring systems in place.  This attack had a significant impact to ICES in terms of direct costs, unavailability of systems for carrying out the business critical tasks of the Committees, and communications and information sharing between ICES and its member countries.  This workshop aims to use the lessons learned during the attack and recovery process, and subsequent analyses to improve cyber-security in the ICES community.
